### What is this?
It's an attempt to build a thorough process for each required 'portion' of the tasks a programmer will receive.

By creating a rigorous process that is carried out for each task, it increases the likihood that the elements of a given program are designed to 'interface' rather than rigidly coupled.  It also increases the readability, and the probably reduces the lines of code by removing logic that isn't absolutely required to accomplish the task at hand.
